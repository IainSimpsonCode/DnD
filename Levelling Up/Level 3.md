# Levelling Up to Level 3
You're all levelling up again! Many of you gain a character archetype here which should allow you to really specialise in one aspect of your characters motif.

## Treasure
You have all gained a decent amount of treasure in the last session. You all gain 325xp from the last session which should take you over the 900xp threshold to level up. 
You also gain 425cp, 27sp and 23gp.

You also all gain 1 inspiration for a very valliant fight against the Champion. You all put up a really good fight!

## Jack
This level up is big for you as you get to pick a Roguish Archetype
- Add 1d8 to your hit dice
- Add 1d8 + your constitution modifier to your max hit points
- Your sneak attack bonus becomes 2d6
- Pick a Roguish Archetype
  - Thief. You become an expert at slight of hand, and you become better at disarming traps and picking locks.
  - Assassin. Sneak attacks become much better with sneak attacks and also with infiltration. At higher levels you can create false identities to sneak past guards.
  - Arcane Trickster. You gain the ability to use magic to help in your sneakyness. You can use cantrips and spells up to 4th level to create illusions to aid your pickpocketing, sneaking, infiltrating and general mischief.
  - Phantom. You gain the ability to talk to the dead. Each short or long rest you can choose a skill or tool proficiency that you dont have and gain it as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You can pick a new skill or tool each short or long rest. You can also deal damage to a secondary target everytime you do a sneak attack to your main target. At higher levels you can become a ghost and move through walls and creatures.
  - Soulknife. Tbh i dont even understand this one really. You can read about it [here](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/rogue:soulknife) if you want. Essentially, you just get a magic sword, and you can telepathically communicate with people at will.
 
### Sneak Attack
I feel as though you may have forgotten this rule, so I will just give you a reminder.
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage (your sneak attack bonus) to a creature you hit if you have advantage on the roll (so if you do a sneak attack, roll a crit, or use inspiration). The attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon. You can also use this without having advantage if: there is another player within 5 feet of the target and that player is not incapacitated; and as long as you dont have disadvantage on your roll.

## Byron
- Add 1d10 to your hit dice
- Add 1d10 + your constitution modifier to your max hit points
- You gain the ability Primeval Awareness
- Pick a Ranger Archetype
  - Hunter. You gain advantages in combat such as dealing extra 1d8 damage each turn. At higher levels, you gain multiattack (you can make multiple attacks on the same turn) and gain better defensive abilities.
  - Beast Master. You gain an animal companion of your choice (no higher than 1/4 challenge rating). The animal can engage in combat with you and will follow commands to the best of its ability. It can also be used outside of combat (eg choosing a hawk that can help scope out enemy camps). If the beast dies, you must spend 8 hours magically bonding with a new animal. At higher levels, your bond becomes greater and the beast can act more independantly of you.
  - Fey Wanderer. You can deal an extra 1d4 damage every time you attack with a weapon. You also learn the *charm person* spell and can learn more spells at 5th (*Misty Step*), 9th (*Dispel Magic*), 13th (*Dimention Door*) and 17th (*Mislead*) level. At higher levels you can summon reinforcements from the Fey Army using *Summon Fey*.
  - Swarmkeeper. You bond with nature and a swarm of nature spirits. In combat you can summon a swarm which deals 1d6 damage and remains for the duration of combat. You also learn the mage hand cantrip. When you cast mage hand, the swarm takes the shape of the mage hand. At higher levels you gain more spells and you swarm becomes more powerful.
 
### Primeval Awareness
You can expend a spell slot and, for 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expended (eg 1 minute for a first level spell slot, 2 minutes for a second level spell slot), you can sense whether any of the following creature types are present within 1 mile: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends and undead. You dont know their location or the number of creatures present.
