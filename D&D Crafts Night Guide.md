## Creating a town
(Dungeon Masters Guide: Chapter 1 and Chapter 4)
When creating a town, you need to think of 3 things:
- The basics (How do the people in your town survive?)
- The purpose (What makes your town different than others? Why do people want to live in your town?)
- The hook (What is there for the players to explore in your town?)

### Basics
- Which dorn is your town located in? Each dorn has different features.
- How big is your town?
- Who lives in your town? What races?
- How does your town get it's food and water? Some foods can be imported, but water is very hard to import enough for a town.
  - Are you near a river, stream or other body of water?
  - Is there a well for your people?
  - Is your town located in a more magical place with access to water via alternate means?
  - Is your town surrounded by farmland?
  - Does your town import it's food?
    - How does your town import food?
    - Does it pillage local towns for resources or have allies that supply food?
- What shops/taverns/entertainment are available for your citizens
- How is your town governed?
  - Is there a mayor?
  - Is there a king?
  - Is there a council?
 
### Purpose
If your town only included the basics, there would be nothing to entice people to emmigrate to your town; They would simply live in the larger, more established cities. Why are people drawn to your town? What makes your town different? Why do people want to live in your town?
- What is your town's industry?
  - Does your town specialise in a specific resource? (mining, farming, clothing, jewellery, etc)
  - Does your town export this resource?
  - How does your town support this industry? Mining industry will require mines, clothing industries will require cotton farms or herds of sheep.
- Is your town home to powerful wizards, or wise and knowledgable scholars?
- Is your town home to a guild, or a faction?

### The Hook
The hook is very similar to the purpose. However, the key difference is that the hook should be something that the majority of your citizens are unaware of. This is the element that opens up interesting adventures for your players. Think about the thieves guild of skyrim, or the black hand.
- Is a group of Kobolds living under your town?
- Is a group of goblins planning a raid
- Is the powerful wizard living in your town secretly evil?
- Is there an organisation planning a coup of the mayor?

## Creating a Dungeon
(Dungeon Master's Guide: Page 72 and Chapter 4 and Chapter 5)
When creating a dungeon, you should think of the following:
- Who inhabits your dungeon?
  - Goblins
  - Kobolds
  - Dwarves
  - Dragons
  - Is it deserted?
- Is your dungeon overground (a manor, or a camp) or is your dungeon underground (a sewer network, an old dwarf fortress, or a cave network)
- Why does your dungeon exist? (think: the reason for your dungeons existance will feed into how it was built. Dwarves will build more square rooms with a focus on efficiency and craftmanship; Kobolds dont tend to build thier own space, but rather fill caves and natural spaces)
  - Was it once a dwarven settlement?
  - A staging ground for an attack
- How did the original inhabitants use the dungeon?
  - Unless your dungeon is designed to be a heavily guarded vault, you are unlikely to have deadly traps in every corridor. Think if you lived in that dungeon, where would you place traps keeping in mind the fact that you would have to disable them every time you walked past them.
- What are the players doing in your dungeon? What is the goal?
- Who are the characters in your dungeon?

Take plenty of creative liberty with dungeons. Create amazing spaces that leave you in awe when exploring. Here are some ideas:
- A dwarf fortress that has been left abandoned. Here you will find a dwarf workshop where the most brilliant engineers have created amazing machines... but they have also created complex traps. As you explore, you find the treasure vault, once stocked high with gold, now pillaged by goblins. One mystery remains... why did the dwarves leave?
- An imperial army camp has taken a prisoner, and you have been hired to take them back.
- A powerful wizard locked themself in a fortress long ago. Recently, noises have been heard outside the old fortress. Inside the fortress you find hoards of magical items, books and potions. However, you also find that the wizard is still there, kept alive by thier necromancy abilities. Over the years, thier mind has been corrupted, and now you need to figure out how to escape alive!

## Creating a Shop
- What does your shop sell?
- How is your shop laid out?
  - What space is there for customers to browse your wares?
  - What space is there behid the counter for staff?
  - Is there a backroom space? (either a kitchen for a bakery, or workshop for an armoury)
  - Where is your stock stored? (if you are an armoury, apothocary, magic shop or any other shop that sells tailored or specialised equipment, you are unlikely to have extra stock as all your stock will be on racks for customers to buy)
- Who are the staff? Are they the owners, or just workers?
  - Name
  - Age
  - Race
  - Interesting facts
