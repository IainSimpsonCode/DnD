# Levelling Up to Level 2
This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to level up to level 2. Byron, please let me know what fighting style and spells you choose. Lily, please let me know what Druidic Circle you choose.
### Multiclassing
If you wish to multiclass, this guide will not apply. Please let me know if you intend to multiclass.

Multiclassing is a really cool way to add extra depth and features to your character, rather than using the cookie cutter character templates. 
When multiclassing, you can choose to gain a level in a second class, rather than levelling up your main class. Eg, you could be a Level 1 Ranger and Level 1 Wizard instead of a Level 2 Ranger.
If you do wish to multiclass, i would like to add it to the main story, rather than it just being something that happens randomly. For example, if you would like to add a level as a Wizard, you would need to complete a quest in the next session to find a wizard that will train you.

Jack and Lewis, this would be a good way to gain the ability to cast spells. 

## Lewis
Do you really need a guide? Like... come on. You've been doing this enough. I think you'll manage on your own. 
Please can you let me know of any new features you gain :)

## Jack
- Your hit dice become 2d8 instead of 1d8
- Add 1d8 + your constitution modifier to your hit points
- You gain the ability Cunning Action
### Cunning Action
During combat, you can use a bonus action to dash (double your movement speed), disengage (move outside melee range without giving an opportunity attack) or hide (move out of the line of sight of an enemy and roll a stealth check to become hidden; gain advantage on attacks if sucessful)

## Byron
You get lots here, a big level up for you!
- Your hit dice become 2d10
- Add 1d10 + your constitution modifier to your hit points
- Choose a ranger fighting style
  - Archery: gain +2 bonus to attack rolls made with ranged weapons
  - Defense: While wearing armour, gain a +1 to your AC making you harder to hit
  - Dueling: Whilst weilding a weapon in one hand, and no other weapons, gain a +2 to damage rolls with that weapon
  - Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon combat, you can add your ability modifier to the second attack (Note: you could always make 2 weaponed attacks, this just removes a de-buff that applies to other players where the second attack does not have any modifiers)
- Gain 2 1st-level spells from the ranger spell list (found in the player's handbook). You can cast these spells 2 times per long rest. Pick 2 of the following.
  - Alarm: Designate an area (no larger than a 20 foot cube) to be alarmed (eg a door, corridor or room). When a creature that is Tiny or larger enters that area an alarm is sounded. You can specify if this alarm is mental (you subconciously hear a ping if you are within 1 mile; this ping wakes you up if you area sleeping), or audible (a bell is sounded for 10 seconds and can be heard within 60 feet)
  - Animal Friendship: you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. If the beast's intelligence is 4 or higher, it fails. Otherwise the beast must make Wisdom saving throw or be charmed.
  - Cure Wounds: a creature you touch gains 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier hit points
  - Detect Magic
  - Detect Poison and Disease
  - Ensnaring Strike: the next time you hit a creature with a weapon, they must make a strength check or be restrained by thorny vines. The target becomes restricted and takes 1d6 damage per turn from the thorns until they sucessfully free themselves
  - Fog Cloud: create a 20 foot sphere of fog for up to an hour
  - Goodberry: Create 10 berries that restore 1hp each when eaten
  - Hail of Thorns: the next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon, the spell creates a rain of thorns that sprout from your ammunition/arrow. In addition to the normal effect of your attack, the target and every creature within 5 feet must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed dex. save, the creature(s) take 1d10 damage; on a sucessful dex. save, the creatures still suffer half the 1d10 damage
  - Hunter's Mark: you choose a creature you can see within 90 feet and mark it. All attacks within 1 hour gain 1d6 damage. You have advantage on Perception and Survival checks to find the marked creature. If the creature drops to 0hp within the duration of the spell, you can pick a new target to mark
  - Jump: you can touch a creature and triple its jump distance for an hour
  - Longstrider: you touch a creature and increase its speed by 10ft for an hour
  - Speak with Animals: you can speak with animals for 10 minutes
  - Absorb Elements: when you are attacked with cold, acid, fire, lightning or thunder damage, you can use a reaction to cast this and gain resistance to that damage type until your next turn. The energy you would have taken as damage is stored and you can inflict an extra 1d6 of that damage type on your first melee attack of your next turn
  - Beast Bond: you gain a telepathic link to a beast you have touched which is friendly or charmed by you. The spell fails if the beat's intelligence is higher than 4
  - Snare: create a nearly invisible snare trap on the floor. When a creature steps into it, it hoists them upside down hanging them 3 feet off the floor
  - Zephyr Strike: You move like the wind. Your movement doesnt provoke opportunity attacks. Once, before the spells ends, you can give yourself advantage on an attack roll; that attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage. Whether you hit or miss, you walking speed extends to 30ft for that turn.
### Spellcasting Ability
As a ranger, your spellcasting draws from your Wisdom. When a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, use your Wisdom. In addition, your spell save DC (what people have to roll to save themselves from your spell) is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. And, your spell attack modifier (what you add when rolling to hit) is your proficiency bonus + your Wisom modifier.

  ### Halo of Spores
  You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores. When a creatures moves within 10 feet of you, or starts thier turn within 10 feet of you, you can use a reaction to unleash the spores on them and deal 1d4 necrotic damage unless they succeed on a constitution saving throw against your spell DC.

When you deal Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total damage. Your melee weapons deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. These effects last for 10 minutes, or until you lose all temporary hit points or until you use Wild Shape again.

  ### Star Map
  Youve created a star chart as part of your studies. This star chart is a Tiny object and can act as a druidic focus for your spellcasting. While holding this map: you know the *guidance* cantrip; you have the *guiding bolt* spell prepared; you can cast *guiding bolt* without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

  ### Starry Form
  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to enter your Starry Form. Your body becomes luminous, your joints light up and glimmer like stars and glowing lines connect them to form a constellaion of your body. This form lasts for 10 minutes.

  - Archer: as a bonus action on your turn, you can hurl a luminous arrow at a target and deal 1d8 + your wisdom modifier damage on a hit.
  - Chalice: When you cast a spell that regains hit points to a creature within 30 feet, you can gain 1d8 + your wisdom modifier hit points too.
